## Data Layer

**Shared SQLite connection factory (`src/db.py`):** Single `connect()` context manager used by both `PortfolioStore` and `MFStore`. WAL mode, `sqlite3.Row` factory, FK enforcement, auto commit/rollback. Any PRAGMA change applies everywhere from one place.

**MF holdings use a transaction ledger model:** `mf_transactions` table stores every SIP/redemption as a plain INSERT. Current holdings derived at query time via `SUM(units)`. Never mutate existing rows — new SIP = new INSERT. Enables full history and attribution.

**NAV data source: AMFI official flat file** (`https://www.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt`). Semicolon-delimited, 6 fields: `code; ISIN growth; ISIN reinvest; name; NAV; date`. No auth, no rate limits. Preferred over `mfapi.in` (third-party dependency) and Upstox (no MF API exists).

**AMFI flat file parsing gate:** `parts[0].strip().isdigit()` — single check that skips category headers, the column header line, blank lines, and malformed rows without any regex.

**NAV snapshots stored per-scheme** in `mf_nav_snapshots`; portfolio-level aggregation happens at query time. Enables per-fund P&L attribution.

**MF data shares the existing SQLite DB** (`data/portfolio/portfolio.sqlite`) — one file, one WAL, one backup target.

**`amfi_code` typed as `str` (pattern `^\d+$`), not `int`** — used as identifier and join key, never as arithmetic. Matches AMFI flat file representation.

**Monetary values stored as TEXT in SQLite** — preserves exact `Decimal` precision through round-trips. Read back via `Decimal(row["col"])`. Applies to: `units`, `amount`, `nav`, `entry_price`, `ltp`, `close`, `underlying_price`, `price` in all tables.

**`get_holdings()` and `get_position()` aggregate in Python, not SQL** — same rationale: keeps exact `Decimal` arithmetic, avoids CAST rounding.

**`mf_transactions` unique constraint:** `(amfi_code, transaction_date, transaction_type)` — idempotent seed via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Assumes one transaction per type per NAV date per scheme.

**`mf_nav_snapshots` conflict policy:** `ON CONFLICT(amfi_code, snapshot_date) DO UPDATE` — last write wins, consistent with `daily_snapshots`.

**`trades` UNIQUE constraint:** `(strategy_name, leg_role, trade_date, action)` — allows one BUY and one SELL for the same leg on the same date (same-day roll), prevents double-seeding.

**MF store tests use `tmp_path`** (file-based SQLite), not `:memory:` — `_connect()` opens and closes a fresh connection on every call, so `:memory:` would lose state between calls.

## Portfolio & Trade Model

**`Leg` vs `Trade` distinction:** `Leg` (in `ilts.py`, `finrakshak.py`) is a conceptual strategy role — instrument + direction + entry price as a definition. `Trade` (in the `trades` table) is a physical execution — what actually transacted, when, at what price. They coexist permanently: `Leg` defines shape; `Trade` drives cost-basis and qty.

**`apply_trade_positions()` bridges Leg and Trade at runtime:** patches Leg qty/entry_price from weighted avg trade data, appends trade-only legs (LIQUIDBEES) as EQUITY/CNC, drops zero-net-qty legs. Returns new Strategy without mutating original.

**Trade overlay internalized in `PortfolioTracker`:** `_get_overlaid_strategy()` / `_get_all_overlaid_strategies()` private helpers apply the overlay before returning. `compute_pnl`, `record_daily_snapshot`, `record_all_strategies` all use overlaid data — no caller manually applies it for these paths.

**Trade-only legs auto-persisted via `store.ensure_leg()`:** When `record_daily_snapshot` encounters a leg with `id is None` (LIQUIDBEES appended by overlay), it calls `ensure_leg(strategy_name, leg)` to upsert and obtain a DB id. Idempotent.

**`trades.strategy_name` must match `strategies.name` exactly:** Canonical names are `finideas_ilts` and `finrakshak`. Mismatch silently disables the overlay — `get_all_positions_for_strategy()` returns empty, no error raised.

**SELL price excluded from weighted average buy price:** Premium received, not capital deployed. `get_position()` only averages BUY prices.

**LIQUIDBEES tracked in `trades` not in strategy `Leg` definitions:** Not a Finideas strategy leg. `apply_trade_positions()` appends it as EQUITY/CNC at runtime so its mark-to-market is included in the ETF component.

**`seed_trades.py` separates `build_trades()` (pure) from `seed_trades()` (I/O):** mirrors `seed_mf_holdings.py` pattern. Tests call `build_trades()` directly with no DB. Dates marked `2026-01-15` are placeholders pending contract note verification.

---

## P&L & Reporting

**`PortfolioSummary` frozen dataclass** in `src/portfolio/models.py`. Carries all combined totals (`mf_value`, `etf_value`, `options_pnl`, `total_value`, `total_pnl`, `total_pnl_pct`) plus four day-delta fields (all `Decimal | None`). `_build_portfolio_summary()` in `daily_snapshot.py` owns all arithmetic.

**Combined portfolio P&L formula:** `total_value = MF current value + ETF mark-to-market + options net P&L`. ETF legs identified by `leg.asset_type == AssetType.EQUITY` (not string prefix).

**Two distinct P&L metrics:** (1) Inception P&L — current value minus total invested; (2) Day-change P&L — today vs previous snapshot via `get_prev_snapshots()` / `get_prev_nav_snapshots()` (MAX date < today, calendar-agnostic). Δday column omitted silently on first run.

**P&L quantization boundary:** `current_value` and `pnl_pct` quantized to 2 dp (ROUND_HALF_UP); `pnl` kept as exact difference so `sum(scheme.pnl) == total_pnl` without rounding drift.

**`PortfolioTracker.compute_pnl()` returns `Decimal`** via `StrategyPnL.total_pnl`. No bridging cast needed when combining with other Decimal values.

**MF snapshot is non-fatal in cron:** the MF block in `daily_snapshot.py` is wrapped in `try/except Exception`. AMFI unreachable at 3:45 PM does not abort the portfolio snapshot.

**AMFI NAV timing:** AMFI publishes after market close (7–9 PM IST). The 3:45 PM cron fetches T-1 NAV for MFs — this is expected and correct. Combined P&L shows mixed-timestamp data by design.

**`FinRakshak protection stats`:** `finrakshak_day_delta` isolated from combined `options_day_delta` in `_build_portfolio_summary`. `_format_protection_stats()` appends hedge verdict (✅/⚠️) to log output and Telegram header.

---

## daily_snapshot.py Design

**Deferred I/O imports:** Module-level imports are stdlib + `src.portfolio.models` only. All I/O-triggering imports (`dotenv`, `UpstoxMarketClient`, `PortfolioStore`, etc.) deferred inside `_async_main()`. Pure helpers importable in tests with zero side effects.

**Single `asyncio.run()` entry point:** entire live-mode logic runs inside `_async_main()`. Historical mode (`--date`) runs in `_historical_main()` — no async needed (DB only).

**`_format_combined_summary()` produces text; `_print_combined_summary()` wraps with print.** Both terminal and Telegram receive identical strings without double-computing or stdout capture.

---

## Client Layer & BrokerClient Protocol

**BrokerClient protocol design (`src/client/protocol.py`):** Three narrow sub-protocols (ISP) — `MarketDataProvider` (tracker/signal), `OrderExecutor` (execution), `PortfolioReader` (monitoring). `BrokerClient` kept flat (not inheriting from sub-protocols) so its full method list is readable. Python structural typing — any class satisfying all 10 `BrokerClient` methods automatically satisfies all three sub-protocols. Stub type aliases (`X = Any`) with `# TODO` comments stand in for Pydantic models not yet in `src/models/`. `from __future__ import annotations` means zero import-time dependency on `src/models/`.

**Composition root pattern (`src/client/factory.py`):** `create_client(env)` is the only `src/` function that imports `UpstoxLiveClient` or `MockBrokerClient` directly. All other modules receive a `BrokerClient` via constructor injection — they import only `src.client.protocol.BrokerClient`. `VALID_ENVS: Final = ("prod", "sandbox", "test")`.

**`UpstoxLiveClient` delegation pattern:** holds `self._market: UpstoxMarketClient` (Analytics Token). `get_ltp` and `get_option_chain` are pure async pass-throughs to `_market`. No inheritance — protocol conformance is structural.

**Two-token constraint:** Analytics Token (long-lived, `UPSTOX_ANALYTICS_TOKEN`) powers market data. Daily OAuth token (`UPSTOX_ACCESS_TOKEN`) required for positions, holdings, margins. `UpstoxLiveClient` currently holds only the Analytics Token; portfolio-read methods raise `NotImplementedError`.

**`NotImplementedError` policy for blocked methods:** Three categories: (1) Order execution — `_raise_order_blocked()` centralises the message; (2) Portfolio read — Daily OAuth token required; (3) Data constraints — historical candles (not wired), expired contracts (paid subscription). Callers see a clear error rather than silent wrong behaviour.

**`MockBrokerClient` design:** Stateful offline broker client. Margin tracked as `Decimal`; order notional deducts `price * quantity * 0.1` as NRML proxy. `simulate_error(method, exc)` is one-shot: fires once on next call, then removed. `reset()` clears orders/positions/error queue, restores default margin; preserves `_price_map` and `fixtures_dir`. Missing fixtures log WARNING, return `None`/`[]`/`{}` — never raises.

**`upstox_market.py` is a pre-protocol legacy module:** Built before the BrokerClient abstraction. Sync `requests` client. Violates DI rule. Wrapped inside `UpstoxLiveClient` — no consumer outside `src/client/` imports it. Do not add new dependents on it directly.

**Error hierarchy (`src/client/exceptions.py`):** Full tree rooted at `BrokerError`: `AuthenticationError`, `RateLimitError`, `DataFetchError` → `LTPFetchError`, `OrderRejectedError` → `InsufficientMarginError`, `InstrumentNotFoundError`. `get_ohlc_sync` and `get_option_chain_sync` raise `DataFetchError` rather than returning empty dicts silently.

---

## Notifications

**Telegram notifier is optional and non-fatal:** `build_notifier()` returns `None` when env vars absent. `send()` catches all `Exception` broadly, returns `False` with WARNING log. The cron never aborts due to Telegram failure.

**Message format:** HTML parse_mode, `<pre>` block for monospace alignment on mobile.

---

## Models & Types

**`frozen=True` for computed types:** `SchemePnL`, `PortfolioPnL`, `StrategyPnL`, `LegPnL`, `PortfolioSummary`, `MFNavSnapshot`, `MFTransaction`, `Trade` — all immutable.

**Enum compatibility:** `Direction`, `ProductType`, `AssetType` use `(str, Enum)` — not `StrEnum` (3.11+ only; project targets 3.10+).

**`nav_fetcher` injected as `NavFetcherFn = Callable[[set[str]], dict[str, Decimal]]`** — tests pass a lambda, production gets the real AMFI fetcher. Missing NAV codes skipped with WARNING, not raised.

**`MFHolding` defined in `src/mf/models.py`**, not `tracker.py` — avoids the circular import that would result from `store.py` importing a type defined in `tracker.py`.

**`src/models/` migration deferred:** Both `portfolio/models.py` and `mf/models.py` are module-local. Migration to `src/models/` happens in one refactor commit when the strategy engine is built.

---

## Nuvama Integration

**Scope: read-only.** Bonds/holdings for margin tracking + EOD positions. Order execution NOT wired for Nuvama.

**Session persistence:** `APIConnect` persists session token in `NUVAMA_SETTINGS_FILE` (path in `.env`). No daily re-auth after first login via `python -m src.auth.nuvama_login`. Unlike Upstox daily OAuth, session survives until explicitly invalidated.

**`parse_holdings()` is a pure function** — maps `eq.data.rmsHdg` response to a flat list. Independently testable without a live session.

---

## Deferred / Not Yet Built

- `src/models/` — shared Pydantic models (both portfolio/ and mf/ migrate here together)
- `src/strategy/`, `src/execution/`, `src/backtest/`, `src/risk/`, `src/streaming/` — all empty
- `OptionChain` Pydantic model — not defined; `_fetch_greeks()` returns `{}` immediately
- `scripts/roll_leg.py` — atomic close + open CLI (needed before JUN 2026 expiry roll 2026-06-30)
- Greeks capture — deferred until `OptionChain` model defined; fixture `nifty_chain_2026-04-07.json` already recorded
- Expired instruments API — blocked (paid subscription). NSE CSV dumps as interim backtest source
- Order execution — blocked (static IP not provisioned). `MockBrokerClient` for all development
- P&L visualization — matplotlib or React dashboard; deferred until several weeks of snapshot history
- `ReplayMarketStream` + `StreamRecorder` — not yet built
- Rate limiter + retry middleware — token bucket decorator; not yet built
