## Conventions (summary)

Each story folder contains:
- `prompt.md` — what the story covers, session start protocol, task overview
- `*_tasks.md` — checklist; find the first unchecked item and do only that
- `*_stories.md` — detailed implementation spec per task
- `*_schema.md` or `*_spec.md` — data models / spec (where applicable)

Full conventions (naming, status transitions, maintenance rules): `docs/archive/plan/README.md`.
