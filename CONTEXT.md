### What Does NOT Exist Yet

- `src/client/protocol.py` — BrokerClient & MarketStream protocols (not written)
- `src/client/upstox_live.py` — UpstoxLiveClient (not written)
- `src/client/mock_client.py` — MockBrokerClient (not written)
- `src/client/factory.py` — client factory (not written)
- `src/models/` — shared Pydantic models (not written; models are local to portfolio/ and mf/ — both will migrate here in a future refactor commit)
- `src/strategy/`, `src/execution/`, `src/backtest/`, `src/risk/`, `src/streaming/` — all empty
- OptionChain Pydantic model — not defined
- Greeks capture — `_fetch_greeks()` returns `{}` immediately (explicit TODO)
- `scripts/roll_leg.py` — CLI to close an old leg and open a replacement in one atomic transaction (not written)
- Trade history model — `Trade`, `TradeAction` not yet defined; no audit trail for rolls/adjustments
- `PortfolioSummary` type — combined MF + ETF + options totals computed inline in `daily_snapshot.py`; should migrate to a frozen dataclass in `src/portfolio/models.py` before the visualization commit
- Day-change P&L in combined summary — today vs yesterday delta from `mf_nav_snapshots` not yet surfaced in output. Data accumulates automatically via cron; display enhancement deferred until 2+ clean snapshots exist (from 2026-04-07 onwards).

### Live Data

- SQLite DB path confirmed: `data/portfolio/portfolio.sqlite`
- DB wiped clean on 2026-04-04 (`daily_snapshots`, `mf_transactions`, `mf_nav_snapshots` all cleared)
- `mf_transactions` re-seeded with all 11 schemes using correct AMFI codes
- `mf_nav_snapshots` empty — first clean snapshot on Monday 2026-04-06 (pre-market run)
- `daily_snapshots` empty — first clean baseline on Monday 2026-04-06 (pre-market run)
- `underlying_price` will populate from 2026-04-06 onwards
- Greeks columns are null across all snapshots
- Cron job set up: `45 15 * * 1-5` — snapshots accumulate automatically from Monday

---

## Key Decisions

### Tokens & Auth
- **Analytics Token** is the primary working token (read-side: quotes, option chain, Greeks, candles, websocket). Lasts 1 year, no OAuth required.
- **Daily OAuth token** (Algo Trading app) needed only for portfolio/positions read and order execution.
- Both tokens stored in `.env`.

### Instrument Keys (verified against live API)
| Instrument | Key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| EBBETF0431 (ETF) | `NSE_EQ\|INF754K01LE1` | ISIN starts with INF (ETF), not INE |
| NiftyBees ETF | `NSE_EQ\|INF204KB14I2` | Discovered Day 1 |
| NIFTY DEC 23000 PE | `NSE_FO\|37810` | Monthly expiry: 2026-12-29 (Tue) |
| NIFTY JUN 23000 CE | `NSE_FO\|37799` | Monthly expiry: 2026-06-30 (Tue) |
| NIFTY JUN 23000 PE | `NSE_FO\|37805` | Monthly expiry: 2026-06-30 (Tue) |
| Nifty Index | `NSE_INDEX\|Nifty 50` | For option chain API and spot price — NOT `"NIFTY"` |

### AMFI Codes (verified against live AMFI flat file on 2026-04-04)
All 11 codes were wrong in the original `_HOLDINGS` — they resolved to completely unrelated schemes,
not even plan-variant mismatches. Root cause unknown (likely copied from a stale or incorrect source).
Every code was replaced by grepping the live AMFI flat file.

| Scheme | Correct AMFI Code |
|---|---|
| Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund - Regular Plan - Growth | 122640 |
| DSP Midcap Fund - Regular Plan - Growth | 104481 |
| HDFC Focused Fund - Growth | 102760 |
| Mahindra Manulife Mid Cap Fund - Regular Plan - Growth | 142109 |
| Edelweiss Small Cap Fund - Regular Plan - Growth | 146193 |
| Tata Value Fund - Regular Plan - Growth | 101672 |
| quant Small Cap Fund - Growth - Regular Plan | 100177 |
| Kotak Flexicap Fund - Growth | 112090 |
| HDFC BSE Sensex Index Fund - Growth Plan | 101281 |
| Tata Nifty 50 Index Fund - Regular Plan | 101659 |
| WhiteOak Capital Large Cap Fund - Regular Plan Growth | 150799 |

**Verification method:** `grep -i "<scheme name>" <(curl AMFI flat file)` — match on scheme name, pick Regular Plan Growth variant. Do NOT trust codes from any other source without verifying against the live flat file.

### API Quirks
- V3 Market Quote: send keys with pipe (`NSE_FO|37810`), response comes back with colon (`NSE_FO:NIFTY...`). Map back via `instrument_token` field.
- Option chain instrument key must be `NSE_INDEX|Nifty 50` — any other format returns empty/error.
- Monthly expiry epoch must use `datetime.fromtimestamp(epoch/1000, tz=timezone.utc)` — local timezone causes IST offset bug (date shifts by one day).
- Monthly NSE options expire last **Tuesday** of the month. Monthly symbols show only month name; weeklies show full date.
- `NSE_INDEX|Nifty 50` can be included in the standard V3 LTP batch call alongside equity and F&O keys — no separate endpoint needed for spot price.
- **Upstox has no mutual fund API.** No MF holdings, NAV, or transaction endpoints exist in V2 or V3. Community requests confirmed unanswered as of Feb 2026.
- **AMFI NAV timing:** AMFI publishes NAVs after market close, typically 7–9 PM IST. The cron at 3:45 PM fetches intraday option LTPs (live) but the MF NAV at that time is T-1. This is expected and correct for MFs — the combined P&L summary shows mixed-timestamp data at 3:45 PM by design.

### Architecture Decisions
- `src/client/upstox_market.py` was built outside the intended BrokerClient protocol abstraction. Works fine for the batch snapshot script, but violates the dependency-inversion rule in the project instructions. Needs wrapping before the next feature module is added.
- Strategy definitions (leg structure, instrument keys) stay in code (`ilts.py`, `finrakshak.py`), not in DB. What goes in DB is trade history — physical executions, rolls, and adjustments under each leg. A `Leg` is a conceptual role; a `Trade` is a physical execution.
- `src/mf/` is a separate module from `src/portfolio/` — different data source (AMFI vs Upstox), different asset class, different lifecycle (SIP cadence vs trade events). P&L is combined at query time, not at model level.
- MF holdings use a **transaction ledger** model (`mf_transactions`) rather than a static holdings snapshot — supports SIP additions each month as plain INSERTs with no mutation of existing rows. Current holdings derived at query time via `SUM(units)`.
- NAV data source: **AMFI official flat file** (`https://www.amfiindia.com/spages/NAVAll.txt`). Published nightly, no auth, no rate limits, **semicolon-delimited** (6 fields: code; ISIN growth; ISIN reinvest; name; NAV; date). Preferred over `mfapi.in` (third-party dependency) and Upstox (no MF API).
- AMFI flat file parsing gate: `parts[0].strip().isdigit()` — single check that skips all category headers, the column header line, blank lines, and malformed rows without any regex.
- NAV snapshots stored **per-scheme** in `mf_nav_snapshots`; portfolio-level aggregation happens at query time. Enables per-fund attribution.
- MF data shares the **existing SQLite DB** (`data/portfolio/portfolio.sqlite`) — one file, one WAL, one backup.
- `amfi_code` typed as `str` (pattern `^\d+$`), not `int` — used as identifier and join key, never as arithmetic. Matches AMFI flat file representation.
- `units`, `amount`, and `nav` stored as `TEXT` in SQLite (not `REAL`) — preserves exact `Decimal` precision through the round-trip. Read back via `Decimal(row["..."])`.
- `get_holdings()` aggregates units, invested amount, and scheme_name in Python, not SQL `CAST` — keeps exact `Decimal` arithmetic for INITIAL + SIP accumulation and REDEMPTION subtraction.
- `MFHolding` is defined in `src/mf/models.py`, **not** `tracker.py` — avoids the circular import that would result from `store.py` importing a type defined in `tracker.py`. `store.get_holdings()` returns `dict[str, MFHolding]`; `tracker.py` imports `MFHolding` from `models`.
- `get_holdings()` returns `dict[str, MFHolding]` where `MFHolding` carries `amfi_code`, `scheme_name`, `total_units`, `total_invested`. `scheme_name` is taken from the most recent transaction for each scheme (all transactions carry the same name in practice).
- `mf_transactions` unique constraint is `(amfi_code, transaction_date, transaction_type)` — ensures seed script idempotency via `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`. Assumes one transaction per type per NAV date per scheme, which AMFI's one-NAV-per-day rule makes practical.
- `mf_nav_snapshots` uses `ON CONFLICT(amfi_code, snapshot_date) DO UPDATE` — last write wins, consistent with `daily_snapshots` in `PortfolioStore`.
- MF store tests use `tmp_path` (ephemeral file-based SQLite), not `:memory:` — `_connect()` opens and closes a fresh connection on every call, so `:memory:` would lose state between method calls.
- `frozen=True` on MFTransaction and MFNavSnapshot — immutable records; mutation goes through the store.
- `MFNavSnapshot` has a `scheme_name` field (denormalised) — required at construction time. The tracker pulls it from `MFHolding.scheme_name` which originates from `mf_transactions`.
- Both `portfolio/models.py` and `mf/models.py` are module-local for now, consistent with each other. Migration to `src/models/` deferred until BrokerClient protocol layer is built — both move together in one refactor commit.
- `SchemePnL` and `PortfolioPnL` are frozen dataclasses defined in `tracker.py` — computed types, not persisted records. `MFHolding` was originally also in `tracker.py` but moved to `models.py` to break the store→tracker circular import. All three migrate to `src/models/` in the same refactor commit as the Pydantic models.
- P&L quantization boundary: `current_value` and `pnl_pct` quantized to 2 dp (ROUND_HALF_UP); `pnl` kept as exact difference so `sum(scheme.pnl) == total_pnl` without rounding drift.
- `nav_fetcher` is injected into `MFTracker` via `NavFetcherFn = Callable[[set[str]], dict[str, Decimal]]` — tests pass a plain lambda, production defaults to `fetch_navs`. Missing NAV codes are skipped with a WARNING log, not raised — the tracker does not know which codes are critical.
- `fetch_navs` missing-code behaviour: absent from result dict, logged at WARNING. Caller decides whether a missing code is fatal. The tracker skips; `seed_mf_holdings.py` is the right place to treat a missing code as an error (not yet implemented — currently silently skips).
- **Combined portfolio summary** in `daily_snapshot.py`: `total_value = MF current value + ETF mark-to-market + options net P&L`. ETF legs identified by `leg.asset_type == AssetType.EQUITY`. `_etf_current_value` and `_etf_cost_basis` are pure helper functions at module level, directly importable in tests with no stubs required.
- `PortfolioTracker.compute_pnl()` returns `StrategyPnL` with `total_pnl` as `Decimal`. No bridging cast needed when combining with other `Decimal` values in the combined summary.
- **MF snapshot is non-fatal in cron:** the MF block in `daily_snapshot.py` is wrapped in `try/except Exception`. AMFI unreachable at 3:45 PM does not abort the portfolio snapshot — it logs a WARNING and the combined summary prints `[failed]` for the MF line.
- `seed_mf_holdings.py` separates `build_transactions()` (pure, no I/O) from `seed_holdings()` (calls store) — `build_transactions()` is independently testable with no DB.
- **daily_snapshot.py import design:** module-level imports are stdlib + `src.portfolio.models` only. All I/O-triggering imports (`dotenv`, `UpstoxMarketClient`, `PortfolioStore`, `PortfolioTracker`, `MFStore`, `MFTracker`) are deferred inside `_async_main()`. This makes the pure helpers importable in tests with zero side effects — no `.env`, no DB, no network.
- **Combined P&L has two distinct metrics:** (1) inception P&L — current value minus total invested, permanent fixture of the summary; (2) day-change P&L — today's value minus previous snapshot in `mf_nav_snapshots`. Both should be displayed. Day-change requires 2+ clean snapshots — will be meaningful from 2026-04-07 onwards.
- **Shared SQLite connection factory** in `src/db.py`: single `connect()` context manager used by both `PortfolioStore` and `MFStore`. WAL mode, `sqlite3.Row` factory, foreign key enforcement, auto commit/rollback. Any PRAGMA change applies everywhere from one place.
- **Error hierarchy in `src/client/exceptions.py`:** `BrokerError → DataFetchError → LTPFetchError`. `UpstoxMarketClient` raises `LTPFetchError` on HTTP errors, empty API response, and missing instrument tokens. `get_ohlc_sync` and `get_option_chain_sync` raise `DataFetchError` rather than returning empty dicts silently. Callers distinguish retryable vs terminal errors by catching at the appropriate level.
- **Monetary field types:** `Leg.entry_price`, `DailySnapshot.ltp`, `.close`, `.underlying_price` are `Decimal`. SQLite stores them as `TEXT` columns to preserve precision through round-trips. `Leg.pnl()` and `pnl_percent()` accept `float | Decimal` — float inputs go through `Decimal(str())` inside the method. Float LTPs from the broker API are converted via `Decimal(str(ltp))` at the tracker boundary before entering any model or P&L calculation.
- **Enum compatibility:** `Direction`, `ProductType`, `AssetType` use `(str, Enum)` pattern (not `StrEnum`) — `StrEnum` was introduced in Python 3.11; the project targets Python 3.10+.

### Deferred
- Greeks fetch: option chain call was failing during portfolio build; deferred until `OptionChain` Pydantic model is defined.
- Expired instruments API: blocked (paid subscription not active). Backtesting uses NSE CSV dumps as interim.
- Order execution: blocked (static IP not provisioned). All order logic via MockBrokerClient.

---

## Current Constraints

| Constraint | Workaround |
|---|---|
| Order execution blocked (static IP required) | MockBrokerClient for all order dev/testing |
| Expired Instruments API blocked (paid tier) | NSE option chain CSV dumps as interim backtest source |
| Greeks columns null in DB | `_fetch_greeks()` early return — fix after OptionChain model is defined |
| `underlying_price` null for pre-2026-04-06 snapshots | DB wiped; clean baseline starts Monday |
| Upstox has no MF API | AMFI flat file as sole NAV source; MF holdings managed via seed script + monthly SIP inserts |
| MF NAV at 3:45 PM cron is T-1 | Expected for MFs — AMFI publishes after market close. Combined summary shows mixed-timestamp data by design. |
| Day-change P&L not yet displayed | Need 2+ clean snapshots; first delta visible 2026-04-07 after Tuesday cron |

## Pre-Task Protocol (for AI assistants)

Before writing any code: read `CONTEXT.md`, state `CONTEXT.md ✓`, confirm file scope, state a one-sentence plan. See `CLAUDE.md` for the full protocol.

## Immediate TODOs (in priority order)

1. **daily_snapshot.py enhancements** — two remaining changes (date parameter done):
   - **Day-change delta in output**: query the most recent prior row from `daily_snapshots` + `mf_nav_snapshots` (use DB max date < today, not calendar arithmetic — handles weekends/holidays automatically). Display format: `current | Δday | inception` for both MF funds and options legs.
   - **Extract `PortfolioSummary`** frozen dataclass from inline computation in `daily_snapshot.py` into `src/portfolio/models.py` — prerequisite for visualization commit.
   - ~~**Date parameter** (`--date YYYY-MM-DD`)~~ — **DONE** (2026-04-07): `_historical_main()` + `_compute_strategy_pnl_from_prices()` added. `PortfolioStore.get_snapshots_for_date()` + `MFStore.get_nav_snapshots_for_date()` added. 23 new tests.

2. **Telegram bot notifications** — send formatted P&L summary to Telegram after each cron run. New module `src/notifications/telegram.py` using raw `requests` to the Bot API (no SDK dependency). Two new env vars: `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID`. Non-fatal: wrapped in `try/except`, Telegram failure logs a WARNING but does not abort the snapshot. Injected into `daily_snapshot.py` as an optional notifier (skipped if env vars absent). Message content: same formatted summary printed to stdout, not raw log lines.

3. **Trade history + roll workflow** — `Trade` model, `TradeAction` enum, `trades` table in store, `scripts/roll_leg.py` CLI. Backfill OPEN trades for existing legs as baseline. Required before JUN 2026 expiry roll (2026-06-30).

4. **Greeks capture** — fix option chain call (`NSE_INDEX|Nifty 50`), define `OptionChain` Pydantic model, implement `_extract_greeks_from_chain()`. Fixture `nifty_chain_2026-04-07.json` already recorded — use it to drive the model definition.

5. **BrokerClient protocol layer** — `protocol.py`, `UpstoxLiveClient` (wrapping current `upstox_market.py`), `MockBrokerClient`, `factory.py`. Required before any new feature module is added. Current `upstox_market.py` is an acknowledged violation of dependency inversion — do not add further modules against it directly.

6. **P&L visualization** — matplotlib script or React dashboard from snapshot time series. Deferred until several weeks of snapshot history exist and `PortfolioSummary` dataclass is extracted (TODO 1).

All 11 AMFI codes corrected against live AMFI flat file. 8-point code review applied (Decimal migration, shared db.py, enum compat, exception hierarchy, deferred I/O imports). 176 offline tests green. DB wiped and re-seeded; clean baseline from 2026-04-06. |
| 2026-04-07 | Reviewed project state and next priorities. Day-change P&L identified as immediately unblocked (2+ snapshots now exist: April 6 + April 7). Scoped 3 new requirements: (1) daily_snapshot.py enhancements — day-change delta + date parameter + PortfolioSummary extraction; (2) Telegram bot notification via raw requests, non-fatal, injected optionally; (3) trade history + roll workflow before JUN expiry. Established CONTEXT.md session log hygiene: collapse absorbed entries, keep only recent 2–3 sessions verbatim. **--date YYYY-MM-DD historical query mode implemented**: `_historical_main()`, `_compute_strategy_pnl_from_prices()`, `PortfolioStore.get_snapshots_for_date()`, `MFStore.get_nav_snapshots_for_date()`. 23 new tests (199 total, all green). |
