## Priority-Ordered Open Work

This list is ordered **story-by-story, not task-by-task**. Each story's tasks in its own
`tasks.md` are a sequence — finish a story's remaining tasks in order before starting the next
story on this list. Do not jump between stories mid-sequence; the ordering below only decides
*which story to pick up next*, once the current one is done. Completed items are in
`docs/archive/TODOS_ARCHIVE.md`.

0e. [ ] **BUG-030 — `_overlay_type_groups` elif-precedence drops `overlay_cc` leg when `overlay_collar_put` also present same-day** (found 2026-08-13, open) — the "NiftyBees vs overlays" digest's `CC No data` line and an understated `Collar` P&L figure both trace to `paper_3track_snapshot.py::_overlay_type_groups()` checking `has_put` before `has_cc` in its `elif` chain, silently orphaning the `overlay_cc` leg from every group whenever `overlay_collar_put` is also present. Orthogonal to BUG-028 (namespace fix, already closed) — this is a leg-role grouping defect BUG-028's four phases never touched. See `docs/bugs/bugs.md` BUG-030, `docs/bugs/task.md` B030.1–B030.6, starting at **B030.1** (entry-side tagging question, blocks the grouping fix).
9. [ ] **IC yearly-expiry residual risk** (2026-07-23) — `docs/plan/ic-yearly-expiry-fix/tasks.md`, starting at **WG-1** (persist per-leg Greeks for weekly expiry bucket; YE-1..YE-4 superseded/already fixed live, see DECISIONS.md BUG-015).
10. [ ] **Greeks Black-Scholes fallback** (2026-07-23) — `docs/plan/greeks-bs-fallback/tasks.md`, starting at **GF-1** (read-only audit scope).
11. [ ] **MVP: Multi-bagger Value Picks Tracker** — `docs/plan/mvp/tasks.md`, starting at **M1.1**. Independent — does not block any other story on this list.
12. [ ] **Variance gate — CSP v1 deployment gate observation** (2026-07-07) — `docs/plan/variance-gate/variance_gate_tasks.md`, starting at **VG0** (spec reconciliation; remaining tasks are human checkpoints, not build tasks).
13. [ ] **Options Income strategy** (2026-06-03) — `docs/plan/options_income/options_income_tasks.md`, starting at **S0** (data audit).
14. [ ] **Telegram IC comparison formatting** (2026-08-07) — `docs/plan/telegram-ic-comparison-formatting/tasks.md`. **TGFMT-1 closed 2026-08-07:** `build_comparison_report()`'s hand-counted fixed-width columns replaced with dynamically computed label/column widths (right-aligned values), porting the approach proven live in `scratch/2026-08-07_telegram_ic_comparison_format_repro.py`. 2 new regression tests (long-label collision, large-value width). 14/14 tests in `tests/unit/strategies/ic/test_paper_ic_monthly_comparison.py` green; wider `tests/unit/` run shows only pre-existing unrelated failures (missing `pandas`/`pyarrow`/`duckdb` in the throwaway `/tmp/pydeps` sandbox install, same class noted in TL-1/BUG-026 sessions). **TGFMT-2..9 superseded 2026-08-07 by item 29 below** — do not pick these up; TGFMT-1 stays as shipped history, its two feature asks (Legs row, Bkd/Flt month-inception split) carried forward into item 29's ROLL-2.
14. [ ] **Backtest Engine** — `docs/plan/backtest-engine/{phase1,phase2,phase3,phase4}/`. Mirrors `BACKTEST_PLAN_PHASE1.md`'s full structure (root doc is canonical; these dirs are thin status pointers). Work through phases **in order** — each phase's GATE task blocks the next phase dir entirely, so this is really 4 sub-stories chained, not 1:
    - **Phase 1** (Aug–Dec 2026 target) — `docs/plan/backtest-engine/phase1/tasks.md`. Gated on the Phase 0.8 variance gate (item 12 above). Starts at **1.3a**/**1.4** (parallel), through **1.12**. Blocks items 15/16 below.
    - **Phase 2** (CSP live + IC paper, ~6mo) — `docs/plan/backtest-engine/phase2/tasks.md`. Gated on Phase 1's **1.12**. Starts at **2.1**. Note: the Parallel Research Tracks named inside this phase in the root doc are tracked via `signals-eval-core` (item 16), not a separate task list here.
    - **Phase 3** (IC live + third strategy + portfolio construction, ~12mo) — `docs/plan/backtest-engine/phase3/tasks.md`. Gated on Phase 2's **2.7**. Starts at **3.1**.
    - **Phase 4** (basket maturity + Finideas evaluation, 2028–2030) — `docs/plan/backtest-engine/phase4/tasks.md`. Gated on Phase 3's **3.6**. Starts at **4.1** (Owner: Animesh — capital-allocation decision, not a Cowork task).
15. [ ] **backtest-eval-core: `BacktestStore` + `src/analytics/`** — `docs/plan/backtest-eval-core/tasks.md`, starting at **B1.1**. Blocked by item 14 (tasks 1.3 + 1.4) — do not start until those land.
16. [ ] **signals-eval-core: regime engine + signal generators + validation** — `docs/plan/signals-eval-core/tasks.md`, starting at **SE1.1**. Blocked by item 15 + item 14's 1.12 gate. Covers both Track A (swing) and Track B (investment) pipelines — SE1–SE8 in full.
17. [ ] **signals: multi-LLM daily signal pipeline** — `docs/plan/signals/signals_tasks.md`, starting at **S1.1**.
18. [ ] **risk-gamma-phase-a, Track B: Near-Expiry Gamma Buy strategy** — `docs/plan/risk-gamma-phase-a/risk_gamma_tasks.md`, starting at **B2.2** (Track A + B1/B2.1 already shipped).
19. [ ] **greeks-parity-validation** (P3, gated on council) — `docs/plan/full-repo-review-followups/greeks-parity-validation/tasks.md`, starting at T1. **Do not implement directly** — requires an `options-strategist`/`greeks-analyst` council consult first (tolerance-band decision).
20. [ ] **paper-pnl-golden-tests** (P3) — `docs/plan/full-repo-review-followups/paper-pnl-golden-tests/tasks.md`, starting at T1 — add exact-value golden assertions for `_compute_leg_unrealized_pnl`.
21. [ ] **suppression-hygiene-triage** (P3) — `docs/plan/full-repo-review-followups/suppression-hygiene-triage/tasks.md`, starting at T1 — REVIEW.md carve-out for self-describing `# noqa` codes.
22. [ ] **Broker abstraction** (LOW priority) — multi-broker parser/adapter layer so data fetching can migrate to Dhan or Kite without touching storage. Storage format (Parquet, SQLite, model field names) is frozen — only fetch + parse changes. Full story: `docs/plan/broker-abstraction/`. 16 tasks (BA-0 → BA-15), starting at **BA-0** (probe scripts + decision matrix). BA-14/BA-15 blocked until `src/execution/` (item 24's OE-1) exists. Do not start until Phase 0.8 gate clears.
23. [ ] **Historical data abstraction** (LOW priority) — `HistoricalCandleFetcher` protocol so VIX and OHLC fetching can switch between Upstox, Dhan, Kite, and NSE CSV without touching storage. Currently `vix_ingest.py` has Upstox URLs hardcoded with sync `requests`; `get_historical_candles` on `BrokerClient` raises `NotImplementedError`. 11 tasks HD-0→HD-10, starting at **HD-0** (cost-bounded probe scripts). HD-6 (Dhan)/HD-7 (Kite ₹2000/month) conditional on HD-0 decision matrix. Do not start until Phase 0.8 gate clears.
24. [ ] **Phase 2 — Research Pipelines & Integrations** (2027+) — `docs/plan/phase2-integrations/tasks.md`, starting at **PV-1** (P&L Visualization — not gated, can be pulled forward independently). **ZK-1**/**OE-1**/**PT-1** are gated per their own stated reasons (Kite Connect priority, static IP, defer-until-touched) — see the story file. Does not include the Swing/Investment signal pipelines — those are item 17 above.
25. [ ] **Technical Debt** (opportunistic — not sequential) — `docs/plan/technical-debt/tasks.md` (**DEBT-3/5/6a/6b/6c/7**). Do not pick these up on their own; each fires only when its named file/module is already being touched for another story's task. See `prompt.md` for the exact trigger per item and why this one breaks the "finish in sequence" rule the rest of this list follows.
26. [ ] **Fix dead IC EOD report query** (2026-08-05) — fix `scripts/strategies/ic/paper_ic_snapshot.py`'s "Intraday actions" query which was identified as dead code during the DT-3a audit.
27. [ ] **Chain delta/decay analysis** (2026-08-06) — `docs/plan/chain-decay-analysis/tasks.md`, starting at **CDA-1**. Exploratory/read-only, independent — does not block or get blocked by anything else on this list. Monthly bucket only (yearly excluded, see item 11's GF-1 findings).
28. [ ] **Entry event filter R4** (2026-07-27, bumped down 2026-08-06) — `docs/plan/entry-event-filter/tasks.md`, starting at **EF-1** (EF-0 done; ES12 dependency already shipped, SHA b86925a — no longer blocking). **Not compulsory — good-to-have.** Soft-warning only (logged, non-blocking, mirrors `GateViolation`); does not gate sizing or entry the way items 4/13 do, and event-day risk is not yet live-capital exposure at the current backtest/paper stage (item 14). `events.yaml`'s election-date leg has no natural refresh trigger and will need ad-hoc upkeep — revisit once entries run fully unattended on live capital (post item 14 Phase 2), at which point also reconsider hard-block instead of log-only.
29. [ ] **Telegram Markdown migration** (2026-08-07, in progress) — `docs/plan/telegram-markdown-migration/`. Migrates all Telegram messaging to `parse_mode=MarkdownV2` via three sequenced sub-stories: `backbone/` (parse-mode switch + escaping audit — closed), `formatting-rules/` (value/table formatting spec — closed, see `FORMATTING.md`), `strategy-rollout/` (per-message-family migration, in progress — through ROLL-3 as of 2026-08-26, next unchecked task per `strategy-rollout/tasks.md`; the former 0g–0l progress markers were archived along with the rest of this file's closed-item backlog in the 2026-08-26 reorg). **Supersedes item 14's TGFMT-2..9.** Full session-by-session design history (ROLL-0 through ROLL-17, format-workshop decisions, FMT-1 sub-rules a-f) archived to `docs/archive/TODOS_ARCHIVE.md` (2026-08-26 reorg) — the epic's own `README.md`/`stories.md`/`tasks.md` are the live spec; this line is a pointer, not the source of truth.

**Before build queue starts on paper-backbone-dependent stories** — verify prerequisites:
```bash
search_graph("StrategyMonitor")   # must return results
search_graph("PaperExecutor")     # must return results
search_graph("CCOverlayV1")       # must return zero results
```

## Animesh-only: Stockmock Calibration Backtests

Prerequisite for item 15 (`docs/plan/backtest-engine/phase1/tasks.md` task **1.1**, which itself
feeds task 1.7's `CSPConfig`). Stockmock UI — no code required.

- [ ] COVID crash (Feb–Apr 2020) — strikes hit, premium, max M2M loss, breach frequency
- [ ] IL&FS crisis (Sep–Oct 2018) — same metrics
- [ ] 2022 rate-hike selloff (Jan–Jun 2022) — same metrics
- [ ] Stable baseline (Jan–Dec 2023) — expected exit-type distribution in normal markets
- [ ] Summarise in [docs/strategies/csp_nifty_v1.md](docs/strategies/csp_nifty_v1.md) under "Calibration Backtest Results (Stockmock)"
- [ ] Commit: `docs(strategies): CSP v1 Stockmock calibration backtest results`

## Session Log

Full forensic log (SHAs, bug numbers, root-cause detail) moved to
[docs/archive/TODOS_ARCHIVE.md](docs/archive/TODOS_ARCHIVE.md) — most recently during the
2026-08-26 reorg (everything from 2026-08-01 through 2026-08-26, plus item 29's inline design
history above). Add new entries there going forward, or start a fresh dated section here if
this file's Session Log grows large again.

### 2026-08-27

- **ROLL-4** (SHA `30bac70`) — migrated `TelegramGateway.send_approval_request`'s message
  formatting: added a bold `*Context:*` section label separating the decision-summary header
  from the escaped `context_str` block, plus a regression test proving an underscore-bearing
  strategy_id/instrument label in the approval body survives escaped. Coordination check against
  `telegram-approval-auth-fix/tasks.md` confirmed clean (only T1, already shipped). Real
  `@code-reviewer` (Opus persona) ran clean: 0 CRITICAL/ERROR/WARNING. See
  `docs/plan/telegram-markdown-migration/strategy-rollout/tasks.md`.
